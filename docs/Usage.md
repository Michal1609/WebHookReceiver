## Component Overview

WebHook Receiver consists of the following components:

1. **WebHookReceiverApi** - ASP.NET Core Web API application that receives webhooks and forwards them to clients using SignalR
2. **WebHookNotifier** - Windows desktop application (WPF) that displays notifications based on received webhooks
3. **WebHookNotifierMaui** - Cross-platform application (.NET MAUI) for Windows, Android, iOS, and macOS
4. **ApiKeyGenerator** - Tool for generating API keys for API security

## WebHookReceiverApi

WebHookReceiverApi is the central component that receives webhooks from external services and forwards them to connected clients in real-time using SignalR.

### Installation and Launch (API)

1. Download the latest version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Michal1609/WebHookReceiver/releases)
2. Extract the `WebHookReceiverApi-[version].zip` file
3. Launch the application using the command:

```bash
dotnet WebHookReceiverApi.dll
```

Or on Windows, you can run `WebHookReceiverApi.exe`.

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5017`.

### API Security

The API is secured using an API key. Each request to the API must include an `X-API-Key` header with a valid API key.

The API key is stored in the `appsettings.json` file in the `AppSettings.ApiKey` section. To generate a new API key, use the ApiKeyGenerator tool.

In addition to the API key for accessing the API, a SignalR key is required for clients to connect to the SignalR hub. This key is stored in the `appsettings.json` file in the `AppSettings.SignalRKey` section.

### Example API Call using cURL

Here's an example of how to send a webhook to the API using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5017/api/webhook" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key-here" \
     -d '{
           "event": "deployment",
           "message": "Application successfully deployed",
           "timestamp": "2025-04-14T12:00:00Z",
           "source": "CI/CD Pipeline",
           "severity": "info",
           "data": {
             "version": "1.0.0",
             "environment": "production",
             "duration": 120
           }
         }'
```

### Data Structure

Webhook data has the following structure:

```json
{
  "event": "string",       // Event type (required)
  "message": "string",     // Message (required)
  "timestamp": "string",   // Timestamp in ISO 8601 format (optional, defaults to current time)
  "source": "string",      // Event source (optional)
  "severity": "string",    // Severity (optional, options: info, warning, error, critical)
  "data": {                // Additional data (optional)
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  }
}
```

### SignalR Key

To connect clients to the SignalR hub, a SignalR key is required. This key is added as a parameter in the URL when connecting to the hub:

```
http://localhost:5017/notificationHub?signalRKey=your-signalr-key-here
```

The SignalR key is stored in the `appsettings.json` file in the `AppSettings.SignalRKey` section.

## WebHookNotifier (Windows)

WebHookNotifier is a Windows desktop application that displays notifications based on received webhooks.

### Installation and Launch (Windows Application)

1. Download the latest version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Michal1609/WebHookReceiver/releases)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I change the API port?

You can change the API port in the `WebHookReceiverApi/Properties/launchSettings.json` file in the `profiles.WebHookReceiverApi.applicationUrl` section.

### How do I secure communication using HTTPS?

To secure communication using HTTPS, you need to:

2. Check if the API port (default 5017) is open in the firewall
3. Try enabling "Use direct WebSockets on Android" in the application settings
4. Check if you have the correct SignalR key

### How do I add a custom notification type?

To add a custom notification type:

1. Modify the data structure in the API request as needed
2. Modify the notification processing in client applications as needed

### How do I change the appearance of notifications?

You can modify the appearance of notifications:
